	<a class="text"> Today, after having a lab with Molly, I made two variations of a rock paper scissors project. One of these variations has the computer facing off against the computer. To do this I used an event listener with a lot of if statements imbeded. I then modified it only slightly so that it was a human versus the computer. To do this I added more event listeners to see which of the rock, paper, or scissors was selected by the human and then had that set to what the second computer was originally in the if statements. I really like this project and I hope you (whoever is reading this) like it too!</a>
