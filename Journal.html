	Journal Entry 1 - Sunday October 2nd <br> 
	Today, in watching the three videos assigned for homework I learned about how to do line breaks (less than sign, br, greater than sign), how to made things bold (less than sign, "strong", greater than sign), (less than sign, "/", "strong", greater than sign) and how to make things italic (same thing but with "em" instead of strong). So far I am feeling pretty comfortable with css and html and am excited for this year in Comp Sci!
