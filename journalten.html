	<a class="header"> Journal Entry - Saturday June 10th </a><br> 
	<a class="text"> This is the journal entry for my final project. For this project I really didn't know what I was going to do until I heard about the third option for the final project. Before that I couldn't really think of multiple of my projects that shared the same theme but then I realize I could try to make an interactive presentation where the person viewing it changes some of my previous projects so that they go with one theme. I first made a version where a few of my projects were changed into being Taylor Swift (who is my absolute favorite artist) themed. I did this mainly by copying the original projects, changing them slightly, and adding links within them to take the viewer to the next page whenever something had to change. Once I had finished with this, I decided to add onto that and created almost the exact same thing for hockey, theater, and filmmaking. This was so fun and a great way to end the year!</a>
